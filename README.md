_disclaimer: in progress_

## What is this?

A list of some of the skills, languages, packages, tools etc. I have learned to work with during my 11 week JavaScript bootcamp at codaisseur.

## Goal

Display the list in a playful way with the use of three.js.

## What is [Three.js](threejs.org)

Three. js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three.js).

Because I wanted to create this list in React I will use [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) and [drei](https://github.com/react-spring/drei).
